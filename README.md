# DDEV Machine-Readable (JSON) Sponsorship Data

Current information about DDEV's sponsors and current needs.

The data here is accumulated from a few sources:

* `all-sponsorships.json` is the summary of all DDEV sponsors. 
* GitHub Sponsors data for the `ddev` organization is updated daily and automatically by the `github-sponsorships.sh` script here.
* GitHub Sponsors data for the `rfay` user (goes into the same DDEV Foundation bank account) is updated daily and automatically by the `github-sponsorships.sh` script here. (A few sponsors started way back when we didn't have the `ddev` org and have never switched over.)
* The `invoiced-sponsorships.jsonc` and `paypal-sponsorships.jsonc` are manually maintained here when generous donors sign up for these avenues.
